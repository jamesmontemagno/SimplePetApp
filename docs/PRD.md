# Pet-Friendly Venues Platform - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Vision
Enable pet owners to confidently discover, evaluate, and share pet-friendly places ("venues")—from cafes and parks to hotels and coworking spaces—while empowering venue owners and the broader community to keep information accurate, trustworthy, and up to date.

## 2. Mission Statement
Become the go-to, community-driven destination for finding and contributing reliable, structured, and actionable information about places that welcome pets of all types.

## 3. Core Value Proposition
- For pet owners: Reduce uncertainty and friction when deciding where to go with their pets.
- For venue operators: Increase visibility to a targeted, loyal audience and gather authentic feedback.
- For the community: Build a trusted, inclusive, and transparent knowledge base of pet accessibility and policies.

## 4. Target Users & Personas
1. Everyday Explorer (Primary)
   - Owns 1–2 pets (often dogs or cats) and seeks casual outings (coffee shops, parks, patios).
   - Pain: Inconsistent or outdated info about whether pets are allowed.
2. Trip Planner
   - Plans regional or travel itineraries including lodging and activities with pets.
   - Pain: Difficulty comparing restrictions across lodging/activities.
3. Multi-Pet Household Manager
   - Owns multiple or unconventional pets (e.g., rabbits, reptiles, service animals).
   - Pain: Unsure of species-specific acceptance, space, or safety.
4. New Pet Owner
   - Recently adopted; wants safe starter-friendly venues and socialization opportunities.
   - Pain: Overwhelmed by policy nuances (leash, vaccination, size limits).
5. Venue Owner / Manager
   - Wants to promote pet-friendly stance while controlling misinformation.
   - Pain: Repetitive inquiries, negative surprises for guests.
6. Advocate / Community Moderator
   - Passionate contributor ensuring accuracy and respectful community tone.
   - Pain: Misinformation and low-quality/spam submissions.

## 5. Problem Statements
- Pet owners lack a centralized, trustworthy source for venue pet policies and real-world experiences.
- Venue policies change, but users have no easy mechanism to flag outdated info.
- Diverse pet types create complexity (service animals, emotional support, exotic pets) not captured in generic listings.
- Reviews elsewhere conflate general quality with pet-friendliness specifics.

## 6. Goals & Success Metrics
### Primary (Year 1)
- Coverage: X% of target metro areas have ≥ N verified venues (exact targets set during go-to-market planning).
- Engagement: >Y% of registered users contribute (add, edit, review, or comment) within first 60 days.
- Trust: ≥Z% of venue pages display “recently verified” status (e.g., within last 90 days).
- Retention: 30-day return rate ≥ target benchmark for community apps.
### Secondary
- Conversion of casual visitors to registered contributors.
- Average time to resolve an accuracy flag under defined SLA.
- Ratio of constructive vs. removed (flagged) reviews.

(Concrete numerical targets to be finalized in collaboration with growth & analytics.)

## 7. Scope Overview
The platform focuses on curated, structured venue profiles enhanced by community input and moderated review quality, starting with common pet categories and expanding.

## 8. Key Use Cases (High-Level User Stories)
1. As a pet owner, I want to search or browse venues by location and pet type so I can plan an outing.
2. As a user, I want to see a venue’s pet policy summary (allowed species, restrictions, amenities) so I can quickly assess suitability.
3. As a contributor, I want to add a new venue with essential details so others can discover it.
4. As a user, I want to submit a review focused on pet experience so I can inform others.
5. As a user, I want to upload optional media (photos) to illustrate pet suitability.
6. As a user, I want to report inaccurate or outdated information so the listing can be corrected.
7. As a venue owner, I want to claim my venue to update policies and respond to feedback.
8. As a returning user, I want to save/favorite venues to plan future visits.
9. As a user with a less common pet, I want to filter venues by specific allowances (e.g., indoor reptiles not allowed) so I avoid wasted trips.
10. As a moderator, I want to review flagged content to maintain quality and trust.
11. As a user, I want to understand accessibility and safety notes (shade, water bowls, off-leash areas) to ensure pet wellbeing.
12. As a traveler, I want to plan a multi-stop itinerary of pet-friendly venues.

## 9. Feature Set (High-Level, No Implementation Detail)
### MVP (Phase 1)
- User accounts & basic profiles

- Venue detail pages (structured attributes: categories, pet types allowed, restrictions, amenities, policy notes)
- Community reviews (pet-experience centric, rating dimensions TBD)
- Photo contributions (with basic submission guidelines)
- Add new venue workflow (pending moderation or validation state)
- Flag/report inaccurate info
- Basic moderation & content quality workflow (internal roles or invite-only moderators)
- Favorites / saved venues list
- Core taxonomy (venue categories, pet types, restriction types, amenities)

### Phase 2 Enhancements

### Future / Exploratory (Not Committed)
- In-app messaging between venue owners and users
- Real-time occupancy or crowd-sourced “busyness” signals
- APIs for travel partners or aggregators
- Pet health integration (vaccination badges from verified sources)
- Offline mode / downloadable city guides

## 10. Out of Scope (Initial Releases)
- Direct booking or reservation system
- E-commerce (pet product marketplace)
- Live chat support
- Complex machine-generated sentiment analysis (beyond manual moderation)
- Real-time map-based live updates (crowd density)

## 11. Data & Content Model (Conceptual Only)
High-level conceptual entities: User, Venue, Venue Attributes (pet policies, amenities, restrictions), Review, Media Asset, Flag/Report, Favorite, Pet Profile, Verification Record, Moderator Action Log. (No schema or technical representation included here.)

## 12. Policy & Trust Considerations
- Clear guidelines for what constitutes acceptable pet photos and review content.
- Distinction between service animals vs. general pet policies (avoid misinformation).
- Mechanism for venue owners to request corrections or dispute reviews.
- Transparent handling of flagged content (status states visible to flagger pending final resolution).

## 13. Moderation Principles
- Prioritize safety and accuracy over volume of content.
- Escalation path for legally sensitive claims (e.g., service animal denials).
- Progressive enforcement (warnings → temporary suspension → removal for abuse).

## 14. Accessibility & Inclusivity (Product-Level)
- Support for screen reader friendly structure and clear icon labels (implementation unspecified).
- Language that is inclusive of non-traditional pets where feasible.
- Consideration for mobility or sensory needs when collecting venue attributes (surface type, noise level—future phase).

## 15. Privacy & Compliance (High-Level)
- Minimal personal data collection; focus on venue and pet context.
- User control over display name and contributed media removal requests.
- Policy alignment with regional privacy regulations (details to be defined with legal).

## 16. Internationalization (Future Preparedness)
- Separate user-generated textual content from structural attributes to enable translation.
- Plan phased rollout by region to seed quality content before scaling globally.

## 17. Success Metrics Deep Dive (Illustrative KPI Dimensions)
- Acquisition: Organic vs. referral traffic share
- Activation: % of new users completing at least one contribution in first 7 days
- Engagement: Average venue detail views per session
- Quality: % of venues with ≥ 3 recent (≤ 180 days) reviews
- Trust: Average flag resolution time; false-positive flag rate
- Retention: Cohort-based 30/60/90 day active percentages
- Growth: Venue coverage growth rate per region

(Final KPI targets to be set with analytics & leadership.)

## 18. Rollout & Phasing Strategy
1. Seed Phase: Manually curate a starter set of high-signal venues in 1–2 metro areas.
2. Invite-Only Beta: Early adopters + moderators refine taxonomy & submission flows.
3. Open Beta: Expand geographic coverage, introduce venue claiming.
4. Public Launch: Marketing push, introduce verification badges and advanced filtering.
5. Growth Iteration: Gamification, partnerships, content quality enhancements.

## 19. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation (Conceptual) |
|------|--------|-------------------------|
| Low initial content density | Users churn early | Focused geo seeding & phased rollout |
| Inaccurate policies | Erodes trust | Verification badges + flag resolution SLA |
| Spam / low-quality reviews | Clutters experience | Lightweight moderation + reputation later |
| Venue owner resistance | Incomplete data | Clear value proposition + claiming tools |
| Legal sensitivities (service animals) | Compliance issues | Clear guidelines & escalation path |
| Scope creep | Delays MVP | Strict phase gating & non-goals list |

## 20. Open Questions
- What pet rating dimensions resonate most (comfort, safety, staff friendliness)?
- Optimal cadence and UX for encouraging verification updates?
- Minimum threshold of reviews per venue before publicly surfacing rating aggregate?
- How to differentiate service animal rights vs venue discretionary policies without legal confusion?
- Which metro areas to target first (criteria: pet ownership density, tourism, community groups)?

## 21. Approval & Stakeholders (Roles Placeholder)
- Product Lead
- Design Lead
- Community / Moderation Lead
- Engineering Lead (for feasibility validation only; no implementation detail captured here)
- Legal / Compliance Advisor
- Analytics Partner

## 22. Change Log
