description: 'Generate a web application based on a PRD'
---
 
Based on the PRD attached, let's generate the entire web application and all of the requirements based on the PRD. With the following in mind:

- Let's use a modern style with graident colors that are in dark pink hues, nice fonts, and plenty of emoji, and have nice hover effects throughout bringing it to life. 
- Make sure we have nice headers for navigation and a footer as well with standard links and copyright information. 
- The site should be responsive and look good on both desktop and mobile devices and work in light and dark modes with a toggle take some time reflect on the design and make it look good. make sure all of the key features are highlighted, use javascript where necessary. 
- I have some pet photos in the wwwroot/images/pets and venue images in wwwroot/images/venues that we could use. Update the existing Home.razor file. 
- Use mock data for now, we will integrate with the backend later.
- Implement the entire PRD as best as possible.
- When you are done, run the app
