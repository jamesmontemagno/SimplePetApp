Based on the PRD below, let's generate a landing page for the application. With the following in mind:

- Let's use a modern style with graident colors that are in dark pink hues, nice fonts, and plenty of emoji, and have nice hover effects throughout brining it to live. 
- Make sure we have nice headers for navigation and a footer as well with standard links and copyright information. 
- The landing page should be responsive and look good on both desktop and mobile devices and work in light and dark modes with a toggle take some time reflect on the design and make it look good. make sure all of the key features are highlighted. 
- I have some pet photos in the wwwroot/images/pets and venue images in wwwroot/images/venues that we could use. Update the existing Home.razor file. 
- Be quick about it, I am doing a keynote and don't have a lot of time.
