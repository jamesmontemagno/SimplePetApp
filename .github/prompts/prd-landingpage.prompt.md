Based on the PRD below, let's generate a landing page for the application. Let's use a modern style with graident colors that are in dark pink hues, nice fonts, and plenty of emoji, and have nice hover effects throughout brining it to live. Make sure we have nice headers for navigation and a footer as well with standard links and copyright information. The landing page should be responsive and look good on both desktop and mobile devices and work in light and dark modes with a toggle take some time reflect on the design and make it look good. make sure all of the key features are highlighted. I have some pet photos in the wwwroot/images/pets and venue images in wwwroot/images/venues that we could use. Update the existing Home.razor file. Be quick about it, I am doing a keynote and dont' have a lot of time.
