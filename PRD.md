# Pet Venue Finder — Frontend PRD (Simplified)

## One-line summary
A mobile-first web app that helps pet owners discover, review, and save pet-friendly venues and manage simple pet profiles.

## Goals
- Help pet owners quickly find pet-friendly places.
- Make it easy to add and review venues from the app.
- Allow users to create simple pet profiles and save favorites.
- Deliver a lightweight, intuitive, mobile-first UX.

## Primary personas
- Local pet owner: needs quick search and favorites for regular outings.
- Traveler/new mover: needs discovery and reassurance from reviews.
- Casual contributor: wants to add a venue or leave a short review.

## Scope — Frontend customer-facing (MVP)
- Search and browse venues by name, location, or tag.
- Venue detail page including name, address, photos, tags, hours, pet rules, average rating, and reviews.
- Add venue flow (minimal form in UI).
- Reviews and ratings flow (1–5 stars + short text).
- Pet profiles: create one or more small profiles (name, type, photo, brief notes).
- Favorites: save/unsave venues to a personal list.
- Authentication flows in UI (sign up, sign in, sign out) — UX only (no service recommendations).
- Responsive design and mobile-first interactions.

## Key user-facing screens
- Home / Search
  - Search box, filters (tags), list and basic card view of results.
  - Optional sort (distance, rating, newest).
- Venue Detail
  - Primary info: name, address, tags, rules.
  - Photo gallery, rating summary, review list, add review button, favorite toggle.
- Add Venue
  - Short form: name, address, tags, optional photo, confirm.
  - Confirmation / thank-you screen after submission.
- Profile
  - User info, list of pet profiles, favorites list.
- Pet Profile Editor
  - Small form for pet name, type (dog/cat), size, photo, short notes.
- Favorites
  - Saved venues list with quick access to details.
- Authentication screens (sign up / sign in / forgot password flows in UI)

## User flows (high-level)
- Search → results → open venue → read reviews → favorite or add review.
- Add venue → fill short form → confirmation → venue visible in search.
- Sign up → create pet profile → favorite venues shown on profile.
- Leave review → review appears in venue detail.

## Data surfaced in the UI (customer-facing only)
- Venue summary: name, address, tags, thumbnail, average rating.
- Venue detail: photo(s), full address, hours, pet rules, tags, reviews.
- Review: rating (1–5), text, reviewer display name, date.
- Pet profile: name, type, optional photo, brief notes.
- Favorites list: venue card references.

## Acceptance criteria (MVP)
- Users can search and see relevant venue results.
- Users can open a venue and view details including rating and reviews.
- Authenticated users (via UI flows) can add a venue and leave a review.
- Users can create a pet profile and mark venues as favorites.
- Forms validate required inputs and surface friendly error messages.

## UX and accessibility notes (customer-facing)
- Mobile-first layout with large tap targets and clear affordances.
- Clear visual hierarchy for ratings and reviews.
- Keyboard and screen-reader friendly navigation and labels.
- Provide empty-state guidance for new users (e.g., "No favorites yet — tap the heart to save a place").

## Success metrics (frontend-focused)
- Time to first venue view after search.
- Conversion: searches → venue views → favorites.
- Number of venues added via the app UI.
- Average review submission rate per active user.
- Engagement with pet profiles (created profiles per user).

## Short roadmap (frontend milestones)
- Milestone 1: Search, results list, venue detail, basic layout and styling.
- Milestone 2: Add venue UI, review flow, favorite toggle, profile creation UI.
- Milestone 3: Polishing, responsive breakpoints, accessibility pass, basic smoke testing.

## Next steps (frontend)
- Create wireframes for the key screens.
- Build UI components for: search bar, venue card, venue detail, review list, pet profile card, favorite button.
- Define a small set of tags/filters to show in the UI.
- Prepare a simple prototype or clickable mock to validate flows with users.
